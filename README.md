# PPrint

PPrint is a pretty-printing library.  The design is primarily based on Philip
Wadler's article
[A prettier printer](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/language-design.html),
which is a redesign of John Hughes's pretty-printing library described in
[The Design of a Pretty-Printing Library](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.38.8777).
A part of Daan Leijen's [PPrint library](http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/pprint.html)
has also been implemented.
